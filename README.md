**Objective:** Develop a machine learning model that accurately identifies and predicts fraudulent transactions in a financial Institution. The goal is to minimize fraud transactions while maintaining high precision, recall rates and F1-Score that ultimately protecting users and reducing financial losses.

**Challenges:**
1. Imbalanced Dataset: Fraudulent transactions typically constitute a small percentage of the total transactions, leading to a highly imbalanced dataset.
2. Real-time Detection: The model needs to make predictions in real-time to prevent fraud.
3. Feature Engineering: Identifying the most relevant features that contribute to accurate fraud detection.
4. Scalability: The solution must handle a large volume of transactions efficiently.
5. Adaptive Learning: Fraudsters constantly evolve their tactics, requiring the model to adapt and learn from new patterns over time.

**Evaluation Metrics:** Precision, Recall, F1-Score and Confusion Matrix
